# C Block
#### A Simple Esoteric Language


### What is C Block?
C block is an esoteric languaged based on C. Everything is the same excpet for the fact that every character is replaced with a corresponding 5x5 ASCII block.
It's ridiculus, it's impractical, it's amazing. I know it's not much but I had a lot of fun making it and I hope you enjoy it too :) See [Blocks.txt](./tools/blocks.txt) character to ascii chart. I have a [c to c block converter](./tools/cblocker) in there too, but hey, whats the fun of an esolang without a little struggle tryna write it ;)
